# Performance_Testing
 This repository has  created with performance testing by using Apache JMeter,  It isa well-known open-source load testing tool, was used for the performance testing in order to assess the system's capacity to handle concurrent requests and gauge its performance under various loads.

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in https:https://blazedemo.com/

500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 35 And Total Concurrent API requested: 3000.
1000 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 100 And Total Concurrent API requested: 6000.
1300 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 106 And Total Concurrent API requested: 7800.
1500 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 81 And Total Concurrent API requested: 9000.
While executed 1500 concurrent request, found 24 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.27%.

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 7800 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.
